Research into various algorithms topics, including Insertion vs Merge sort, Dijkstra's implementations and the Knapsack


1. Insertion vs Merge sort
   
It is common knowledge merge sort outperforms insertion sort in large arrays, but how small is too small for merge sort to excel?
In this repo, I aim to discover the size of arrays where Insertion outperforms Merge sort, and use this number to implement a Hybrid sort.
The Hybrid sort will recursively split the arrays like Merge sort, then use Insertion sort for its relative efficiency on small arrays.


3. Dijkstra's: Adjacency List or Matrix?

In this repo, I aim to find the ideal data structure for perhaps the most famous algorithm in the field of computing.


5. The Knapsack Problem

A deep dive into one of computer science's classical problems in dynamic programming.
